# GUI-White-Black-Box-Models-Mix

This repository contains the code of a GUI developped during a 3-month intership in the Computer Intelligence Laboratory of Osaka Metropolitan University.

It consists in a simple GUI where the user can select differents classifiers and their hyperparameters and run experiments. Results are then displayed in the form of graphs, 
schemas and statistics.


Warning: the number of features needs to be known when selecting the maximum number of considered features in some models
-> Better to use ratios (float) instead of numbers (int)
