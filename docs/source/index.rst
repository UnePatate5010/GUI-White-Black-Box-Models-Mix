GUI-White-Black-Box-Models-Mix documentation
============================================

Welcome to the documentation of GUI-White-Black-Box-Models-Mix. This GUI is a intership project at Osaka MEtropolitan University. The repository can be found
on `GitHub <https://github.com/UnePatate5010/GUI-White-Black-Box-Models-Mix>`_. The goal is to provide an interface in which users can try out an ensemble 
classifier, with a lot of different parameters and statistics. Check the :doc:`getting_started` section for basic explanations.

This documentation provides an overview of the GUI and its components. However, the code is not really discussed nor the method that it exposes. For the latter,
please refer to the `original research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08973>`_.
